# Neural Network implementation by scratch
For this project i've decided to implement a Neural Network for simple image classification. the goal would be to implement it without using any particular library for Machine Learning,
relying only on mathematic and matrix computation. The dataset considered is the MNIST dataset, a very simple dataset that allows us to focuse on the mathematics behind NNs.

I've decided to extende the purpose of this project by implementing a small library that allows us to decide the structure of our NN and visualize it. By doing this I can do a small study
on the performances of the NN build based on the number of layers and the number of perceptrons. The study has been based on both accuracy achieved and time spent to train the model.
